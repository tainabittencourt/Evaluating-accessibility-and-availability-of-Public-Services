This code uses some of the databases generated by previous analyses. You can check them on other repositories on my GitHub page (https://github.com/tainabittencourt).

And big thanks to all other GitHub pages which immensely contributed to the scripts used in this project, particularly Rafael Pereira (https://github.com/rafapereirabr), Robin Lovelace (https://github.com/Robinlovelace) and all countless contributors of Stack Overflow.
